Document Operations (DocOps) is a documentation philosophy based on agile software product development. Simply put, DocOps promotes the ideas, that everyone that develops a product should document it from their perspective in small fragments using the tools they use.  Dynamic documents are assembled from the fragments to meet the needs of a given audience.

We are a group of product developers that have been challenged multiple times to unravel the task of large scale, multi-audience documentation.  We are developing a series of tools and services to lower the barriers of DocOps at any scale.  Often leveraging other open source projects from other amazing teams and fantastic engineers, we are developing the best documentation experience we can.
